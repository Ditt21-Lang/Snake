# üêç Snave - Snake Cave

**Snave** (short for *Snake Cave*) is a game inspired by the legendary classic *Snake*, but reimagined with modern twists and exciting new features that make the gameplay more thrilling and challenging.

Unlike the typical Snake game, **Snave** takes you into a cave full of surprises, portals, and bullets! You won‚Äôt just be avoiding walls ‚Äî you'll dodge moving obstacles and enemies too!

# ‚ú® Features
- **Endless Mode:** Play like the classic *Snake* game and aim for the highest score possible!
- **Stage Mode:** Reach a score of 1000 to advance to the next level ‚Äî up to level 5! The higher the level, the harder the enemies and obstacles become.
- **Reverse Snake:** Instantly swap your head to the tail position for a quick turnaround! (Stage Mode)
- **Portal:** Shoot portals at walls and use them strategically to teleport across the map! (Stage Mode)

# üéÆ Gameplay Instructions

- **Movement**
  - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move in the desired direction.
  - The snake moves continuously in the last chosen direction until you change it.

- **Game Over**
  - There are 4 things that can cause a game over: Walls, stone obstacles, your own body, and enemies (_minecarts_).
  - If the snake hits a wall or its own body, the game ends instantly regardless of remaining lives.
  - If it hits a stone or enemy, 1 life will be lost. The game ends when your lives reach 0.
